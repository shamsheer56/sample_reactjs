# Install on Ubuntu
Node.js is a JavaScript platform for general-purpose programming that allows users to build network applications quickly. By leveraging JavaScript on both the front- and back-end, development can be more consistent and designed within the same system.

    Open the Terminal and type `sudo apt-get install nodejs` then `sudo apt-get install npm`
    apt package manager downloads some files and installs them.

To make sure you have Node and NPM installed, run two simple commands to see what version of each is installed:

    1. To see if Node is installed, type `node -v` in Terminal. This should print the version number.
    2. To see if NPM is installed, type `npm -v` in Terminal. This should print the version number.

Check out the git repository, then do

	1. `cd angular_sample` 
	2. `npm install`
	3. `npm start`
	4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Install on Mac

Installing Node.js and NPM is pretty straightforward using Homebrew. Homebrew handles downloading, unpacking and installing Node and NPM on your system. The whole process (after you have XCode and Homebrew installed) should only take you a few minutes.

    Open the Terminal and type  `brew install node`
    Homebrew downloads some files and installs them.

To make sure you have Node and NPM installed, run two simple commands to see what version of each is installed:

    1. To see if Node is installed, type `node -v` in Terminal. This should print the version number.
    2. To see if NPM is installed, type `npm -v` in Terminal. This should print the version number.

Check out the git repository, then do

	2. `npm install`
	3. `npm start`
